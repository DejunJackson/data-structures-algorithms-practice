# data-structures-algorithms-practice
This is just a repo to track my progress while learning data structures and algorithms. Each folder depicts
the type of problems that I store in them. Each file contains information about:

1. **Where** I completed the problem (e.g. what site)
2. A **description of the problem** 
3. The **time and space commplexity** I ended with
4. The **time to arrive to an efficient solution**
5. My **notes while solving the problem**
6. The actual **code**
